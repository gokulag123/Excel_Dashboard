Store_Sales_Excel_dashboard
Hi All,

In this Project I have created an Excel Dashboard for a store which has both 
sales on varies platforms.

* First of all Cleaned the data thoroughly removing invalid columns and rows.
* Made all data in a consisitent format like all men to be marked as Men not like M,m,men.
* Created certain columns using Excel formulas for analysis purpose for example :
Age group has been created :
Age >60, "Super Senior",
Age>40,  "Senior",
Age>20,  "Youth",
Age>13,  "Teenage" .

* Created Pivot tables and pivot charts from them for better visualization.

* Created a dashboard consolidating them.

For increasing the sales among men especially in teenage category which we have very less sales %, we could create a promotional campaign also  some offers to grab attention like "Special Sale".
For our loyal customers from Maharastra,Karnataka etc we can have some offers especially for woman in youth age group in the month of March.
